                <p> Recently Bangladesh Sylhet area has been flooded with heavy rains.

                    Millions of people have lost much more with their homes.
                    Our aim is to stand by the side of these lost people

                    <p>It is not enough for us to just help. The amount of flood damage is much higher. So in addition
                        to helping , we need to create public awareness. This is not posible for anyone alone. So we
                        should spread it amoung all and work together. We will even alert those outside the cuntry thoes
                        who are working as Rementence worker. And we will invite them too to bea a part of us.</p>

                    <p>The main problem of Banavasi people is food. Everything, including the homes of many people, has
                        gone into the water. This has ruined everything including their food. Food is needed first to
                        survive. So the first thing we are doing is providing food for these Banavasi people. In the
                        initial stage, we are trying to give dry foods such as chira molasses wrapped dates</p>

                    <p>The floods have filled the place with garbage. Many people have become ill.
                        They need treatment and medicine. We will try to give them first aid. And I will give you some
                        necessary medicines like Orsaline cold, fever, cough. We have doctors who will give first aid to
                        the Banavasi people and take care of them</p>
